[![CI](https://github.com/shamazmazum/material-reconstruction/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shamazmazum/material-reconstruction/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This library provides the means for reconstruction of 2D images via simulated
annealing based on Sâ‚‚ correlation function. Additional documentation is
available [here](https://shamazmazum.github.io/material-reconstruction/).

## C dependencies

* FFTW3
* OpenCL

## Additional reading

Random Heterogeneous Materials, Salvatore Torquato.

## TODO

* Generate a decent initial approximation, like in our `MaterialReconstruction.jl`
package.
